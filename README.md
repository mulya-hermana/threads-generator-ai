# Threads-Generator-AI
AI-powered tool to automatically generate engaging Twitter/X threads from a given topic or text.
Threads Generator AI is a modern Chrome Extension that helps you generate, organize, and copy engaging threads for platforms like Twitter or Threads.net using either OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Google Gemini APIs.

# 🚀 Features
✍️ Custom Thread Generator — Generate threads based on a topic and writing style.
📐 Character Limit Control — Set a max character count per thread part (e.g., 300 characters per bullet).
🎭 Multiple Writing Styles — Choose from friendly, professional, funny, concise, provocative, motivational, educational, narrative, and more.
📁 Folder Management — Create, select, reset, and delete folders to organize your threads.
🌙 Dark Mode — Toggle dark/light themes and preserve preferences.
🔑 API Key Flexibility — Use either OpenAI or Gemini API key (auto-detects).
📋 Copy to Clipboard — Copy each tweet-part individually with a single click.
💾 Persistent History — All threads are stored locally, even after you close the extension.

# 🛠 Installation
Clone or Download this Repository.
Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser.
Enable Developer mode.
Click Load Unpacked and select the project folder.
Done! The extension will appear in your toolbar.

# 🔧 Usage
Click on the extension icon to open the popup.
Enter your thread topic, choose a style, and (optionally) a max character limit.

# 🧠 How It Works
This extension uses your provided API key to send prompts to either:
OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo Up
Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash
It formats the output as short tweets/posts, splits based on your character input, and presents them cleanly in collapsible folders.

# 📌 Example Prompt Behind the Scenes
“Tulis thread tentang: cara meningkatkan produktivitas dengan gaya profesional. Gunakan emoji bila perlu. Bagi menjadi beberapa bagian yang masing-masing maksimal 280 karakter. Formatkan agar setiap bagian thread terpisah satu per baris.”

# 🔐 API Key Notes
OpenAI key format: sk-...
Gemini key format: AIza...
Your key is stored locally in your browser’s extension storage (if “Save API Key” is checked).
